Student Grade Prediction & Risk Assessment
Overview

This project predicts students' final grades and categorizes their academic risk (High/Medium/Low) using machine learning. Early identification of at-risk students helps educators provide targeted interventions and improve learning outcomes.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Deployment via a Flask web application for real-time predictions
